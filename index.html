                <p>Education: I graduated from UNC Charlotte on May 13th, 2017 with a B.A. in Language and Digital Technology. After graduating I decided to move to Charlotte permanently.</p>
                <p> Soon after graduation I heard about the UNCC CodingBootcamp, as the program draws to a close I am looking for new career opportunities. </p>
                <p>I am also learning coding languages not included in the BootCamp curriculum, and I have no problem learning more for a job, or just to learn something new to expand my coding knowledge. </p>
                <p>Currently I am looking for a Entry Level Full Stack Developer position in Charlotte, but am open to other Developer Positions.</p>
                <p>Check out my Portfolio page for examples of my work.</p>
